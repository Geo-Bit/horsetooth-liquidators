# NoCo Hackers 2024 Holiday CTF Prompt

Sly, a tired and overworked fox, was the lead developer and sysadmin at Horsetooth Liquidators Inc., a rapidly growing liquidation company in Fort Collins. When he first joined, he was excited about the challenge of building the company’s e-commerce platform from scratch. But as the company expanded, so did Sly’s responsibilities. With no extra help in the IT department, he was stretched thin, juggling new feature requests, server maintenance, and keeping the company’s web infrastructure running smoothly.

Over time, the system began to show cracks. Sly knew there were vulnerabilities he hadn’t had time to fix—SQL injections, outdated encryption, and exposed API endpoints. Each day he feared an attack was looming, but with every plea to the CEO, Mr. Badger, for more resources, he was met with the same response: “No budget for extra staff. Just keep things running, Sly.”

Sly did his best, patching what he could while trying to meet deadlines for new features. But the stress was catching up with him. His fur was frazzled, and he felt a sinking pit in his stomach whenever a new security alert popped up.
Finally, after an especially close call when an attempted attack almost broke through, Sly had enough. He confronted Mr. Badger, insisting that the company needed help before a real disaster struck. After much grumbling and hand-wringing, Mr. Badger relented.
“We’ll bring in a penetration tester,” Mr. Badger said. “But it better not cost too much.”

Enter Thumper, a sharp and resourceful rabbit from Briarwood Security, a well-known firm that specialized in uncovering vulnerabilities. Thumper had a reputation for being thorough, and he wasted no time setting up his tools. His mission was clear: test the infrastructure at Horsetooth Liquidators from top to bottom, identify every flaw, and recommend fixes.

Sly, feeling a mix of relief and nervousness, sat nearby, ready to assist but also anxious about what Thumper might uncover. He had done his best, but he knew there were gaps.

Thumper, calm but focused, ran his initial scans and began probing the system. The fate of the company's security now lay in the hands of the rabbit—and the vulnerabilities he was about to expose.

Now it’s your turn! As Thumper, the skilled penetration tester, you’ve been brought in to identify and exploit vulnerabilities in the company’s infrastructure. Your task is to expose these weaknesses before an actual attacker does. Can you uncover the flaws that Sly hasn’t been able to fix?
