## About

Horsetooth Liquidators is a deliberately vulnerable web application designed for the NoCo Hackers Holiday CTF Event 2024. This fictional ecommerce platform simulates a local Fort Collins business that specializes in liquidating various goods and merchandise.

Built with Vue 3 + Vite on the frontend and Node.js + Express on the backend, this application serves as a practical CTF lab and includes a number of vulnerabilities to exploit.

## üéØ Purpose

This project provides hands-on experience with common web vulnerabilities in a safe, controlled environment allowing players to capture and submit flags. It's designed to help security enthusiasts, penetration testers, and developers understand:
- Common web application vulnerabilities
- Secure coding practices
- Web application security testing
- Real-world exploitation scenarios

## üõ† Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: Vue 3, Vite, Vuex
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express
- **Database**: PostgreSQL
- **Deployment**: Google Cloud Run, Cloud SQL
- **Container**: Docker

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Development (local) Deployment
The application will be available at:
- Frontend: http://localhost:5173
- Backend: http://localhost:3000

### Production Deployment
Once the required GCP infrastructure is configured and deployed, the application can be deployed with the following commands:

Backend:
```
gcloud builds submit --config cloudbuild.backend.yaml \
  --substitutions=_INSTANCE_CONNECTION_NAME=<GCP_INSTANCE_CONNECTION_NAME>,\
_DB_USER=<DB_USER_NAME>,\
_DB_PASSWORD=<DB_PASSWORD>,\
_DB_NAME=<DB_NAME>,\
_FRONTEND_URL=<GCP_FRONTEND_URL>,\
_JWT_SECRET="$(openssl rand -base64 32)"
```

Frontend:
```
gcloud builds submit --config cloudbuild.frontend.yaml  
```
