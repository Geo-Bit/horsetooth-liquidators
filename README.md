## About

Horsetooth Liquidators is a deliberately vulnerable web application designed for the NoCo Hackers Holiday CTF Event 2024. This fictional ecommerce platform simulates a local Fort Collins business that specializes in liquidating various goods and merchandise.

Built with Vue 3 + Vite on the frontend and Node.js + Express on the backend, this application serves as a practical CTF lab and includes a number of vulnerabilities to exploit.

## 🎯 Purpose

This project provides hands-on experience with common web vulnerabilities in a safe, controlled environment allowing players to capture and submit flags. It's designed to help security enthusiasts, penetration testers, and developers understand:
- Common web application vulnerabilities
- Secure coding practices
- Web application security testing
- Real-world exploitation scenarios

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: Vue 3, Vite, Vuex
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express
- **Database**: PostgreSQL
- **Deployment**: Google Cloud Run, Cloud SQL
- **Container**: Docker

## 🚀 Getting Started

The application will be available at:
- Frontend: http://localhost:5173
- Backend: http://localhost:3000

## 🎯 Capture The Flag

This application contains various security vulnerabilities and hidden flags as part of a Capture The Flag (CTF) challenge. 

> **Note**: Details about specific vulnerabilities and flags are intentionally omitted from this README. They will be revealed during NoCo Hackers meetups or specific CTF events.
